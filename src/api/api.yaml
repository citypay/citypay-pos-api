    CityPay Point of Sale API for payment with card present devices including EMV readers and contactless POS readers.

    The API is available from https://github.com/citypay/citypay-pos-api

    The API makes it simple to add EMV and contactless card acceptance to iOS, Android, Tablet and desktop applicaitons using a HTTPS protocol. It segregates the complexity of payment processing from the sales environment and eliminates any necessity for the target system to handle card data.
